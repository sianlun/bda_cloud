# Welcome to Big Data Analytics in the Cloud

I wish to start populating a repository that keeps my materials for the Big Data Analytics in the Cloud class.

Technologies covered:
1. Hadoop MapReduce
2. Hadoop Streaming
3. Hadoop Ecosystem (Pig, Hive, Sqoop)
4. Spark
5. AWS Cloud Computing

And more as I improve the contents. 

Meanwhile, I welcome any comments or suggestions. You can reach me @ sianlunl+REPLACE-AT+sunway.edu.my
